# RideAlong: a Carpooling App

RideAlong is a carpooling app that provides a platform for drivers to connect with potential passengers to share rides. In many cases, a car is a faster, simpler, more flexible and less expensive option to get to your destination than using public transportation is. But many people do not have access to a car or only need one in rare circumstances. Similarly, many drivers may prefer having passengers when they drive, whether it is for company or to help mitigate the cost of gas. RideAlong simply helps users connect with others whose needs align with their own.

Using RideAlong, a driver with an upcoming trip can list their trip with relevant details and the number of seats they would like to make available to be booked. People looking for rides can then search for the date and location they need and see a list of available rides that match their search.

After booking, drivers and passengers can see information specific to their trip, including a map with the meeting location. On the day of the trip, drivers and passengers can check in once they have arrived at the meeting location to help other members of the trip find them.

RideAlong implements a React.js front-end, a Django REST API back-end, MySQL database, and Google Maps and Geolocate APIs.
